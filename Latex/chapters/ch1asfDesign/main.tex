\label{ch:asfDesign}


\begin{chapterabstract}
TThe design of complex architectural components such as kinetic architectural elements poses a challenge due to the the multiple technological branches involved. This chapter presents a performative design environment that combines the branches of structural and energy engineering, control, industrial design, and architecture. The methodology is applied in the context of the Adaptive Solar Facade, a kinetic photovoltaic shading system for the HiLo building in Duebendorf, Switzerland. The chapter describes how the environment enables the user to design the form of the facade, get feedback on its structural strength, analyse the energetic performance of the interior space, conduct a daylighting analysis, render images, and produce fabrication plans for a rapid design process. With the parametric design environment, project meetings transform from information exchanges to design sessions where all stakeholders can collaboratively influence the design and see immediate results. What would normally take a month, was condensed to just a few hours. Ultimately, this chapter extends the field of performative design by presenting a practical example where a system as complex as a kinetic photovoltaic envelope can be designed, prototyped, and fabricated by a small team of four designers.

% \Citet{Maxwell1865} derived some very useful equations for electromagnetic
% fields:
% \begin{align}
%     \nabla \cdot \vec{D} = \rho \\
%     \nabla \cdot \vec{B} = 0 \\
%     \nabla \times \vec{E} = -\frac{\partial \vec{B}}{\partial t} \\
%     \nabla \times \vec{H} = \vec{j} + \frac{\partial \vec{D}}{\partial t}
% \end{align}

% The energy--momentum relation, \cref{eq:energy-momentum}, is one of \emph{my}
% important results:
% \begin{align}
%     E^2 = m^2 c^4 + (p c)^2 \label{eq:energy-momentum}
% \end{align}

% Write units like this: \u{5}{\micro\meter}.
