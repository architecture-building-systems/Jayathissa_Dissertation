\begin{chapterabstract}
AAn adaptive solar facade can improve building energy performance by controlling solar heat gains and natural lighting, while simultaneously generating electricity on site. The adaptive control of the solar facade is determined through an optimisation algorithm that minimises the net energy demand. In this paper, we first evaluate the sensitivity of the adaptive solar facade to the thermal performance of the building envelope for a south facing room in Zurich. We then evaluate the performance of an adaptive solar facade on 11 building use types spanning six construction periods. In addition, we compare the performance of an adaptive system against an equivalent static photovoltaic system, and a facade with no shading system. Our results show that the adaptive solar facade performs best in buildings that have a high cooling demand and low heating demand. This is because the optimum configurations for cooling minimisation generate the maximum photovoltaic electricity. As a result, we notice a higher energy saving potential in newer buildings with low envelope thermal transmittance (U-value or infiltration). However, in buildings with a very high cooling demand, and no heating demand, there is only a small improvement in performance compared to an equivalent static system. An adaptive solar facade is therefore an optimum solution when there are both heating demands, and cooling demands present. Modern offices, retail stores, food stores, and schools have this property and perform well with an adaptive solar facade compared to an equivalent static system, and a facade with no shading.

% \Citet{Maxwell1865} derived some very useful equations for electromagnetic
% fields:
% \begin{align}
%     \nabla \cdot \vec{D} = \rho \\
%     \nabla \cdot \vec{B} = 0 \\
%     \nabla \times \vec{E} = -\frac{\partial \vec{B}}{\partial t} \\
%     \nabla \times \vec{H} = \vec{j} + \frac{\partial \vec{D}}{\partial t}
% \end{align}

% The energy--momentum relation, \cref{eq:energy-momentum}, is one of \emph{my}
% important results:
% \begin{align}
%     E^2 = m^2 c^4 + (p c)^2 \label{eq:energy-momentum}
% \end{align}

% Write units like this: \u{5}{\micro\meter}.
